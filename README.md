# Train-the-Trainer Training Lesson Plan

## Description

This lesson will prepare you to train meetup, WordCamp, and other event organizers to run Diversity Outreach training workshops in their local communities.

## Prerequisite Skills

*   Experience running a meetup, WordCamp, or similar event
*   Appreciation of the benefits of diversity and inclusion
*   Familiarity with common WordPress-community communication tools (Zoom, Slack, etc.)

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

*   locate and work with the [Meetup Workshop Tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195OBnYAOIvZNeoOSmginTtwzY8yegWCQWWm4Jf31gik/edit#gid=2024231725)
*   locate and share via Zoom the course training video
*   help local organizers set the scope and schedule for their Diversity Outreach trainings
*   impart the rationale for favoring presenters who are members of the under-represented group

## Assets

Here are the files/materials the instructor needs to teach the lesson plan.

## Screening Questions

Evaluate students to see if they have the skills necessary to learn and understand the lesson. 

*   Have you worked with speakers as a Meetup or WordCamp organizer?
*   Have you conducted speaker training or similar trainings before?
*   Are you committed to improving the representation under-represented populations at WordPress events?

## Teacher Notes

Tips and other information for the instructor.

*   As you begin the class, create a Slack Direct Message group for the class participants (this has worked better than the native chat feature in Zoom and is a tool that WordPress community folks are already familiar with and to which they can refer back to after the class)
*   Point out early in the class intro that while the Speaker Training/Diversity Outreach lesson plan page simply list all five modules, the first three modules are actually the core of the curriculum while the "better speaker" and "great slides" lessons are for reference
*   Let the students know that this content is equally applicable to meetup and WordCamp organizers
*   Be ready to address the importance of having a person from the targeted under-represented group lead the talk

## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Start Zoom Call & Invite Students

If you have scheduled the Zoom call and sent invitations ahead of time, most students will show up on time, but you may need to reach out, typically via the Making WordPress Slack.

### Introductions

Round of introductions:

*   Name
*   Pronoun
*   Location of your Meetup or WordCamp
*   What you are hoping to get out of today

### Instructions

Today we are going to watch a recording that is 1 hour and 20 minutes. This is a hands-on workshop. When the folks in the recording are working on the exercises, please work on the exercises along with them.

During the video you can ask questions in the chatroom or on Slack.
*Post a “hello” in the chatroom or Slack so that they can see where it is.*

I will also be putting prompts into the chatroom during the recording for you.

There will be a chance to ask questions via webcam after the recording.

### Assuring the Students

As we are going through all 5 modules in a short time, sometimes the material in the recording goes quickly. The aim is not to teach you everything but rather to get you feeling comfortable with going through the material on your own and seeing how you can adapt it as you need to for your group.

### Share Screen And Play Recording

1. Click on up arrow next to the "Share Screen" icon at the bottom of the Zoom window
2. Select the window in which you are running the [training video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/owcnwuvk1idfci0/Diversity%20Speakers%20Workshop%20Training%20March%2027%2C%202018.mp4?dl=0)
3. Verify that the students can see your screen share
4. Play the video

### Things to Post in the Chat During the Video:

*   link to the lesson plans when mentioned: https://diversespeakers.info/
*   at the "Reasons" exercise:
    *   “Here’s a spot you can write down your own reasons”
    *   “Here is another writing exercise for you to follow along doing”
    *   “If you’re following along with the exercises, I’ll ask for your answers in a moment on what topic you’d choose I’ll ask after the Refining Topic exercise”
    *   “If anyone has a topic from doing these exercises, this is your chance to share it with us”
    *   “We did create the Slack group, so let me know if you’d like to be invited to it.”

### Questions After

Do you have any more questions? You can ask in the webcam or in the chat window.

### Other Video Training

If you would like to get a feel for seeing how to run a module in real time, we have a recording of module 1 that also has train the trainers notes along with it.

If they ask for it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/26k8ugga5022hou/DiversityOutreachSpeakerTrainingDec20-2017.mp4?dl=0

### Getting Support

To get more support with running the lessons, we have a Slack channel. Let me know if you’d like to be on that.

If they ask for it:

### Conclusion

* What is one thing that you got out of this training?
* Was anything unclear?
* Any questions?

We will be sending you an email with the important links as well as a follow-up questionnaire. Please watch for that.

### After the Training

After people attend a Train the Trainers, we update two places:

1. On HelpScout we mark them as being trained and set their email status to Closed. (Unless we agreed to have more contact with them, then we leave it open.)

2. On our spreadsheet we mark them as being trained in purple. It is important to get their city (or region), so if you don’t have that already, be sure to follow up with them and ask!
