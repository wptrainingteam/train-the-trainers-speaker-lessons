## Prerequisite Skills

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

## Screening Questions

A list of evaluation questions for students to see if they have the skills necessary to learn and understand the lesson. These can be used as pre-screening questions on Meetup.

*   Have you worked with speakers as a Meetup or WordCamp organizer?
*   Have you conducted speaker training or similar trainings before?
*   Are you committed to improving the representation under-represented populations at WordPress events?

## Teacher Notes

A bulleted list of any handy tips or information for the instructor.

*   As you begin the class, create a Slack Direct Message group for the class participants (this has worked better than the native chat feature in Zoom and is a tool that WordPress community folks are already familar with and to which they can refer back to after the class)
*   Point out early in the class intro that while the Speaker Training/Diversity Outreach lesson plan page simply list all five modules, the first three modules are actually the core of the curriculum while the "better speaker" and "great slides" lessons are for reference
*   Let the students know that this content is equally applicable to meetup and WordCamp organizers
*   Be ready to address the importance of having a person from the targeted under-represented group lead the talk

## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Start Zoom Call & Invite Students

If you have scheduled the Zoom call and sent invitiations ahead of time, most students will show up on time, but you may need to reach out (typically via the Making WordPress Slack

### Introductions

Round of introductions:

*   Name
*   Pronoun
*   Location of your meetup
*   What you are hoping to get out of today

### Instructions

Today we are going to watch a recording that is 1 hour and 20 minutes. This is a hands-on workshop. When the folks in the recording are working on the exercises, please work on the exercises along with them.

During the video you can ask questions in the chatroom.
*Post a “hello” in the chatroom so that they can see where it is.*

There will be a chance to ask questions via webcam after the recording.

### Assuring the Students

As we are going through all 5 modules in a short time, sometimes the material in the recording goes quickly. The aim is not to teach you everything but rather to get you feeling comfortable with going through the material on your own and seeing how you can adapt it as you need to for your group.

### Share Screen And Play Recording

1. Click on up arrow next to the "Share Screen" icon at the bottom of the Zoom window
2. Select the window in which you are running the [training video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/owcnwuvk1idfci0/Diversity%20Speakers%20Workshop%20Training%20March%2027%2C%202018.mp4?dl=0)
3. Verify that the students can see your screen share
4. Play the video

### Things to Post in the Chat During the Video:

*   link to the lesson plans when mentioned: https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/speaker-training/
*   at the "Reasons" exercise:
    *   “Here’s a spot you can write down your own reasons”
    *   “Here is another writing exercise for you to follow along doing”
    *   “If you’re following along with the exercises, I’ll ask for your answers in a moment on what topic you’d choose I’ll ask after the Refining Topic exercise”
    *   “If anyone has a topic from doing these exercises, this is your chance to share it with us”
    *   “We did create the Slack group, so let me know if you’d like to be invited to it.”

### Questions After

Do you have any more questions? You can ask in the webcam or in the chat window.
